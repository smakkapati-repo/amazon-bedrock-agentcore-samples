    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to integrate Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory capabilities with LlamaIndex to create an Investment Portfolio Advisor. We'll focus on **short-term memory** persistence within a single client consultation session - allowing the advisor to remember client profiles, portfolio holdings, market analysis, and investment recommendations throughout a financial advisory session.\n",
